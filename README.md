# Eye Tracking System for Parkinson’s Detection

This project is a wearable system that tracks eye movement in real time to detect key Parkinson's symptoms like abnormal saccades and blinking patterns. It uses an infrared camera, a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W, and a custom Python-based feature extraction pipeline.

## What It Does

- Detects pupil position (x, y)
- Calculates pupil area and axes
- Tracks blink rate
- Identifies saccades (fast eye movements)
- Sends data wirelessly to laptop
- Ready for AI model integration
